# JS30 Custom Video Player
Exercise 11 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials. 

After yesterdays exercise and seeing the length of todays I was not very confident going in. However all the logic sank in today and it was great to see Wes set up the video player layout. 

For my bonus I went ahead and fixed the volume/speed sliders so that they only update upon having the mouse held down instead of just hovering the mouse over the slider i.e. 'mousemove' event. 
I added a play from the beginning button as well as seen in common streaming apps like netflix.
